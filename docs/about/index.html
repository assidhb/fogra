He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover <strong>strong</strong> it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, link waved abouthelplessly as he looked.</p><h3 id=the-bedding-was-hardly-able-to-cover-it>The bedding was hardly able to cover it</h3><p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer a solid fur muff into which her entire forearm disappeared..</p><h3 id=things-we-know-about-gregors-sleeping-habits>Things we know about Gregor&rsquo;s sleeping habits</h3><ul><li>He always slept on his right side.</li><li>He has to get up early (to start another dreadful day).</li><li>He has a drawer and a alarm clock next to his bed.</li><li>His mother calls him when he gets up to late.</li></ul><p>It was very easy to throw aside the blanket. He needed only to push himself up a little, and it fell by itself. But to continue was difficult, particularly because he was so unusually wide. He needed arms and hands to push himself upright.</p><blockquote><p>At first he wanted to get off the bed with the lower part of his body, but this lower part (which he incidentally had not yet looked at and which he also couldn&rsquo;t picture clearly) proved itself too difficult to move. The attempt went so slowly.</p></blockquote><p>When, having become almost frantic, he finally hurled himself forward with all his force and without thinking, he chose his direction incorrectly, and he hit the lower bedpost hard. The violent pain he felt revealed to him that the lower part of his body was at the moment probably the most sensitive.</p></main><footer><p>Copyright 2023.
